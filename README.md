# STAT 451 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Classification

This course provided an introduction to machine learning with a focus on pattern classification, regression analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. 
For each topic, I studied both foundational algorithms and selected contemporary, state‑of‑the‑art methods. A major emphasis was placed on evaluating machine learning models using statistical techniques. 
Statistical pattern‑classification approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian decision theory—were examined alongside algorithmic and nonparametric methods to highlight their differences and applications. 
While the mathematical principles underlying these algorithms were covered in depth, equal attention was given to hands‑on practice using open‑source machine learning libraries within the Python ecosystem.
